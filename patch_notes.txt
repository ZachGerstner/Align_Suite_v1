-Modified Attr, nw1, nw.h
-started to fix pointer issues
	-utilize pointer in prototype in nw.h
	-utilize pointer for reading in sequences
Todo
	-utilize pointer for passing sequences to math

2 March 2018
-Tried to figure out pointer pass (pointer solution not going to work)

3 April 2018 
+convert seq x,y to pointers
+pass those pointers to align
+manipulations should stay

4 April 2018
-converted seq to string 
-converted get_attribute_seqx/y to string*
-error in printing debug stuff need to convert to cout <-.->
-added strings in get_attr_seq functions pointed seq*
-compiled and worked (converted to cerr)
-seq was not read in needs different read in thing

6 April 2018
-added cin.ignore to address manual read in option.
+pointers still not behaving, need a static solution or to restrcture.
Todo
	+implement either a static solution or a restructure of function calls
	+write calculation of NW score
	+write Align function
	+change exit to a loop back for the program.
